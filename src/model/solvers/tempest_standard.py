# Tempest Standard Solver
# This solver is a standard solver for the Tempest model. It is a simple solver that uses a 
# simple forward Euler method to solve the temperature equation. It is based on thermprojrs of 
# Spencer et al. 1989, Icarus 78 with a key modification. The base layer temperature is fixed 
# at the end of each day to the previous day's mean surface temperature (T^4)^0.25. This is 
# leads to very fast convergence of the model.

# Limitations: (Read this is you are getting weird results)
# The model works well when the diurnal curve is "curvy", but not when it has sharp transitions, 
# and it may crash or give you strange behaviour, like very high surface temps, or a midday dip.
# This is common for explicit time-stepping solvers. You are most likely to run into issues looking 
# at low thermal inertias at low solar distances. If this happens you can increase the number of 
# timesteps per day, but it will quickly become very computationally expensive. An implicit solver 
# may be a better option, but is yet to be implemented in TEMPEST.
